# Research Portfolio

Welcome to my research portfolio! This site highlights my current projects, publications, and teaching activities. It is built as a static site and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Summaries of recent and ongoing research projects in 360° video, XR streaming, and multimedia systems.
- Links to peer‑reviewed papers, technical reports, and datasets.
- Project gallery with images and interactive demos.
- Contact information and links to my professional profiles.

## Building

The site uses simple HTML/CSS with a GitHub Actions workflow to publish changes. To run locally:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IamArmanNikkhah/research-portfolio.git
cd research-portfolio
# open index.html in your browser
```
